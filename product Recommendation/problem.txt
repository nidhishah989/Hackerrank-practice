1. Product Recommendations
An e-commerce company has a platform that uses an algorithm to suggest products to users. it uses a graph-based approach, where each node represents a product, and the edges between them represent similarities. To avoid recommending too many similar items, they implement a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm that takes into account the similarity score.

Here is the JavaScript code snippet:
function dijkstra(graph, startProduct) {	

	let n = graph. length;

	let minDistances = new Array (n). fill(Infinity);
	let visited = new Array (n).fill(false);

	minDistances[startProduct] = 0;

	for (let i= 0; 1 <nj its) {
		let minIndex = -1;
		for (let j= 0; j< n; j++){
			if (!visited[j] && (minIndex === -1 | | minDistances[j] < minDistances[minIndex])) 
                        {
				minIndex = j;
                        }
                } 
		if (mindistances[minIndex] === Infinity) {
			break;
                }
                
                 visited[minIndex] = true;

		for (let j = 0; j<n; j++) {
			if (graph[minIndex][j] !== 0) {
				let potentialDist = minDistances[minIndex] + graph[minIndex][j]
                                if (potentialDist < minDistances[j]) {
					minDistances[j] = potentialDist;
                               }
                       }
		}
        }
      
       return minDistances;
}

Given an adjacency matrix that represents the similarity scores between different products:

 let graph = [
        [0,2,0,1,0],
        [2,0,3,0,0],
        [0,3,0,4,0],
        [1,0,4,0,5],
        [0,0,0,5,0]
    ]


What is the output when the recommendation system calls dijkstra(graph,0); to find the least similar products to the current product(Product 0)?
